# prioritized todos
  * writeup of prototype and plan
  * 'give' primitive
  * further core primitives: union, difference, groupby
  * branching and sum types
  * existentially typed index ranges
  * first pass at compilation with llvm
  * differentiation
  * plotting
  * cached incremental evaluation
  * script-centered workflow with repl :dump (session to script)
  * row polymorphism
  * prelude and demos
  * type declarations
  * something typeclassish for e.g. '+' on int/real

# nice-to-haves
 * syntax
   * multiline layout syntax
   * comments
 * tab format - cosmetic
   * simple strings without quotes
   * avoid repeating keys
   * use fixed numeric precision
  * interactive ggplot and raster images (b/w and color) - via canvas?
   * interact with extra dimensions via, sliders, or facets
  * tables allowed as keys, and implement string keys that way
